# OSS-Fuzz

[Fuzz testing] is a well-known technique for uncovering programming errors in
software. Many of these detectable errors, like [buffer overflow], can have
serious security implications. Google has found [thousands] of security
vulnerabilities and stability bugs by deploying [guided in-process fuzzing of
Chrome components], and we now want to share that service with the open source
community.

In cooperation with the [Core Infrastructure Initiative] and the [OpenSSF],
OSS-Fuzz aims to make common open source software more secure and stable by
combining modern fuzzing techniques with scalable, distributed execution.
Projects that do not qualify for OSS-Fuzz (e.g. closed source) can run their own
instances of [ClusterFuzz] or [ClusterFuzzLite].

[Core Infrastructure Initiative]: https://www.coreinfrastructure.org/
[OpenSSF]: https://www.openssf.org/

We support the [libFuzzer], [AFL++], [Honggfuzz], and [Centipede] fuzzing engines in
combination with [Sanitizers], as well as [ClusterFuzz], a distributed fuzzer
execution environment and reporting tool.

[libFuzzer]: https://llvm.org/docs/LibFuzzer.html
[AFL++]: https://github.com/AFLplusplus/AFLplusplus
[Honggfuzz]: https://github.com/google/honggfuzz
[Centipede]: https://github.com/google/centipede
[Sanitizers]: https://github.com/google/sanitizers
[ClusterFuzz]: https://github.com/google/clusterfuzz
[ClusterFuzzLite]: https://google.github.io/clusterfuzzlite/

Currently, OSS-Fuzz supports C/C++, Rust, Go, Python and Java/JVM code. Other
languages supported by [LLVM] may work too. OSS-Fuzz supports fuzzing x86_64
and i386 builds.

## Learn more about fuzzing

This documentation describes how to use OSS-Fuzz service for your open source
project. To learn more about fuzzing in general, we recommend reading [libFuzzer
tutorial] and the other docs in [google/fuzzing] repository. These and some
other resources are listed on the [useful links] page.

## Trophies
As of February 2023, OSS-Fuzz has helped identify and fix over [8,900] vulnerabilities and [28,000] bugs across [850] projects.
